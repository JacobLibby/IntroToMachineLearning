A Culmination Of An Independent Study In Machine Learning


During my Senior year at Wheaton College, MA, I conducted an independent study in Machine Learning with Mark LeBlanc. During this course, we dove into a large survey of Machine Learning techniques, and developed a codebase for future students to experiment with and learn from.

This repo is split into two main sections:
  1) Decision Tree
  2) Support Vector Machine (SVM)


For each of these ML approaches, I created models for two datasets:
  1) Poe Dataset
  3) Iris Dataset
