# Support Vector Machines

When analyzing data using Support Vector Machines (SVM), it is important to understand the output that you will need to be interpreting. An SVM outputs a Confusion Matrix, which is a (usually 2x2) grid that compares the true labels of the data to the predicted labels from the model.
Although getting your hands dirty is the best way to learn, here is a quick tutorial on understanding confusion matrices made by DataSchool.io https://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/
